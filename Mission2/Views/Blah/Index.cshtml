<!--Paragraph on what I hope to achieve from the class, expectations-->
<h2>What I hope to achieve from this class:</h2>
<p>
    My goal in this class is to become an absolute ASP.NET and C# guru wizard extravaganza.
    I hope to learn under Prof Hilton's monstrous wing as I tackle any
    challenges put before me. By the end of the semester I hope to be able to
    harness the skills necessary to create a world changing webapp. I want people 20 years
    from now to see my group's webapp and say, "Wow, we still can't figure out
    how they did that." I want people to write books about my group. I want to
    be on the cover of CodersWeekly.
    These are my conditions. You have one day.
